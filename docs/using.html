GRUB has both a simple menu interface for preset options from a
configuration file, and a highly flexible command-line for performing
any desired combination of boot commands.<P>

The first action GRUB takes after it is loaded is
to look for it's configuration file.
If one is not found, then
it drops into the command-line interface (and stays there).
If one is found, the full menu interface is activated containing
whatever entries were found in the file (the command-line is still
available via a command from the menu interface).<P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="cmdline">Command-Line Interface</A></H2>

The command-line interface provides a prompt and after it an editable
text area much like a command-line in DOS or UNIX.  Each command is
immediately executed after it is entered.  The
<A HREF=commands.txt>list of commands</A> are a subset of those available
in the configuration file, used with exactly the same syntax.<P>

Cursor movement and editing of the text on the line can be done
via a subset of the functions
available in the BASH shell (C-f forward, C-b backward, C-a beginning
of line, C-e end of line, C-k delete to end, C-u delete to beginning;
the PC left and right arrow keys, HOME, DELETE, and END work as well).<P>

When typing commands interactively, if the cursor is before the "="
character in a command being typed, pressing the TAB key will display
a listing of the available commands, and if the cursor is after the
"=" character, the TAB will provide
a completion listing of disks, partitions, and filenames depending on
the context.<P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="menu">Menu Interface</A></H2>

The menu interface is quite easy to use.  It's commands are both
reasonably intuitive and described onscreen.<P>

Basically, the menu interface provides a list of "boot configurations"
to the user to choose from.  Use the arrow keys to select the entry
of choice, then press ENTER to run it.  An optional timeout is available
to boot the default entry (the first one if not set),
which is aborted by pressing any key.<P>

Commands are available to enter a bare command-line (operating
exactly like the non-config-file version of GRUB, but allowing one to
return to the menu if desired) or to edit any of the "boot
configurations".

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="editor">Menu Entry Editor</A></H2>

This looks much like the main menu interface, but with the lines in the
menu being individual commands of the selected configuration instead of
configuration names.<P>

If an ESC is pressed in the editor, it aborts all the changes made to
the configuration entry and goes back to the main menu interface.<P>

When a particular line is selected, then it
places the user in a special version of the command-line for editing
that line.  When the user is finished, GRUB replaces the line in question
in the "boot configuration" with the changes (unless it was aborted via
ESC, and in that case the changes are thrown away).<P>
